## deg4uss3r's solutions:

I wrote these in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html), you can run these by compiling in debug mode and running the binary like so: 

```
cd ./GetCryptic/solutions/ricky_rust/cryptopals
cargo build 
./target/release/cryptopals
```

Id you have any Rust questions feel free to ping me on irc degausser@[freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net/)
